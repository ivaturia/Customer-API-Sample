This is a sample mule application with embedded Derby database.
I have taken the SQL scripts and followed the configuration steps from this website https://dejim.com/setup-an-embedded-derby-database-in-mule-4/ and I totally give credit to Dejim Juang for the SQL Scripts sample and steps for Derby configuration.
How to use this code?
